# Skoltech ML course, 2020

Some implemented features that may become useful later:  

* HW2, part1: 
    - plotting with customizable layout (HW2, part1), 
    `plt.GridSpec` from `matplotlib.pyplot`
    - highlighting cells of pd.DataFrame object, 
    `.style.apply(color_fn)`
    - example of two aligned horizontal barplots
    with adjusted tick labels
* HW2, part2:
    - theory problems

* HW3, part1:
    - nothing

* HW3, part2:
    - a bit of theory, just a little

There were 4 homeworks; 
HW1 and HW4 contained nothing useful, so I didn't upload it
