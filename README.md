# Skoltech ML course, 2020

***Some implemented features that may become useful later:***

**Homeworks**

* HW2, part1: 
    - plotting with customizable layout (HW2, part1), 
    `plt.GridSpec` from `matplotlib.pyplot`
    - highlighting cells of pd.DataFrame object, 
    `.style.apply(color_fn)`
    - example of two aligned horizontal barplots
    with adjusted tick labels
* HW2, part2:
    - theory problems

* HW3, part1:
    - nothing

* HW3, part2:
    - a bit of theory, just a smattering

*There were 4 homeworks; 
HW1 and HW4 contained nothing useful, so I didn't upload them*

**Project**

*See the project description in
[the project folder](https://github.com/lukoshkin/ml2020/tree/master/project)*

* Exponentially dilated causal convolutions
* Recurrent and convolutional encoder for time series
* Recurrent and convolutional decoder for time series
* Convolutional classifier for time series
* Convolutional Regressor for time series reconstruction
  from persistence landscapes
* Oversampling technique (implemented in PyTorch)
* Some other tools
